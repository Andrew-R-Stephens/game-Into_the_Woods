<h1>About Into The Woods</h1>
<p><em><b>Into The Woods</b></em> exists to satisfy the software portion of the Software Engineering curriculum at <b>SUNY College at Old Westbury</b>. We are instructed to create a software solution with our assigned team and use it to create the documentation.</p>
<p>This is a 2D platformer game which derives ideas from platformer titles like <em>"Ori and the Blind Forest"</em>.</p>
<p>The entire game was developed from scratch, save for two libraries, <em>"javazoom"</em> and <em>"Gson"</em>, which assisted in audio streaming and Json file parsing, respectively.</p>
