<h1>About Into The Woods</h1>
<p><em><b>Into The Woods</b></em> exists as the software portion of the Software Engineering class at <b>SUNY College at Old Westbury</b>.</p>
<p>This is a 2D platformer game which derives a likeness from many other platformers like <em>"Ori and the Blind Forest"</em>.</p>
<p>The entire game was made from scratch, save for two libraries, <em>"javazoom"</em> and <em>"Gson"</em>, which assisted in audio streaming and Json file parsing, respectively.</p>
